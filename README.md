# 🎬 CINEVO — Movie Ticket Booking App

A modern movie ticket booking web app built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. This application offers a seamless experience with support for dual login roles: Admin and User. Admins have the ability to add and edit movies, while all users can edit their personal information, browse movies, book tickets, and view their ticket booking history. Additionally, the app ensures data persistence using Redux Persist, allowing users to retain their preferences and booking details across sessions.
